# my game patrono. 
this is my first python pygame game, i hope you like it
  
  
# what to do?   
the target is to touch as much targets as posible.   
there is no max time, but there is a timer. You can agree with your friends (if you have some) to each play to a certain amount of time and look who gots the most points, to see your points just look at the digit behind punten.  (your friends need to also download this game or play it when you are finished becouse sadly this is not a multiplayer game).

# controls. 
to go up with block/character you need to hold the space bar or the up arrow on your keybord, if you do it right then de energie bar on the right side at the bodem of your screen will fill up, if you think it has enough energie you can let the key loos. after a liitle bit of time your energie will reset and you can press space or the up key again.  

To walk to your right and or your left you use your left arrow key and your right arrow key or key a and key d. you will move much slower on the ground then you do in the air.  

If you are falling really hard and you want to slow down falling to get more time to reach your target you can press the arrow down key or shift. this will open a parachute for you to land save.  

As last we have the controls for the music. the game plays 1 music standard that is music one. you can change the music by holding tab and clinking 1, 2 or 3 (3 difrent musics).
